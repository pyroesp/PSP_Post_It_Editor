# PSP Post It - Editor

## Compiling
Use the [pspdev/pspdev docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pspdev/pspdev) and add [libintrafont](https://github.com/pspdev/libintraFont) to it.  

Just run ```make``` in the source folder to compile.  
Run ```make clean``` to clean the folder of the compiled files.

## Controls
Navigate the menu with the up/down buttons.  
Select an option with X.

## Legacy
Legacy code from the original homebrew is in the legacy branch.  
I've made some changes so it compiles today.  
Legacy code crashes on exit, haven't looked at why.
